        <h3>First Project</h3>
            <p>This was my first real project where I had freedom to learn about the fundamentals of CSS and HTML.This seemingly easy 
            project taught me a lot about CSS styling and to not be afraid to try different styling until I find something that I like. 
            My biggest challenge was to align the text boxes side by side. After that, I played with the styling for the picture and was 
            able to get the picture to have the same dimensions as the text boxes.This was my first real project where I had freedom to learn about the fundamentals of CSS and HTML.This seemingly easy

        <h3>Second Project</h3>
            <p> This is my second project where I first explored putting links within a webpage that linked to webpages that I had 
            made as well. I expanded on the fundamentals that I had learned in the previous project which include things like styling 
            font, backgrounds, borders, and spacing.</p>
